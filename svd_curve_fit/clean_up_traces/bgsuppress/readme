Background supression using L1 edge detection.

Usage:
==============================
Assuming complex data with wrappped phase in a matlab matrix dat2 of size Ny x Nx x Nt.

alpha = bgsup3(angle(dat2),abs(dat2).^m,struct('nth',1e-4));

- m is 1 or 2 and is a data weighting. Theoretically m=2 should be used, practically m=1 is often better.
- the parameter nth coverns how much backgound is removed. Larger nth removes more backgound but will also remove more of the signal
- Nt can be 1, however there is an abitrary additive constant offset in each solution, resulting in artefacts between slices.


LS ARMA for multi echo data
============================
If more than one echo is collected a signal model with one peak can be used to estimate the phase.
In this case dat2 has size Ny x Nx x Ne x Nt.

% results in a ppm map of size Ny x Nx x Nt and a t2-star map of same size
[ppm,t2s,a,b] = CSI_LS1(dat2);
ppm(isnan(ppm))=0; % make sure there is no "not a number" in the results
 
% apply phase unwrapping and bg suppression:
w=squeeze(mean(abs(dat2),3)); % mean of mag over all echos
alpha = bgsup3(ppm,w.^m,struct('nth',1e-4));
